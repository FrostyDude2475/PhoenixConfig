PhoenixConfig
=============

A set of modular config files for people to use.

The Modular Configs


People always have a bit of time making mods require each other and that sort of thing. These configs, which would be separate downloads, could be dropped into the config folder to replace the normal Universal Configs. These would do things to make mods require each other even more than the Universal configs do.
There is also a special part of this that we have inadvertently created: The MineTweakerLib. This contains every item from every mod we're going to ever reference. Neat, right? The best part: You can copy and past all of the values that we've assigned into your own scripts, for easier editing. We've grouped them by mod and sub-mod, in certain cases!


Modules would include (once again, all optional):

Botania/Blood Magic

Thermal Expansion/Buildcraft

Thermal Expansion/Mekanism

Thermal Expansion/IC2 (Blasphemy, I know)

Thaumcraft/Blood Magic

Thermal Expansion/IC2/Mekanism

Blood Magic/Thermal Expansion

Witchery/Twilight Forest

Railcraft/Steve's Carts

etc...



There will also be more as I think of them, along with some big packs that would encompass a lot of changes centered around a single mod:

Running Red (Blood Magic, not to be confused with Gideonseymour's Modpack)

The Quest (HQM)

Industrialization (IC2)

Good Guy Greg (GregTech)

Overheat (Thermal Expansion)

Kill Them With Flowers (Botania)

Vis (Thaumcraft)

etc...

These all require the mod(s) they are related to, as well as Minetweaker 3. Some of these also require Modtweaker.
